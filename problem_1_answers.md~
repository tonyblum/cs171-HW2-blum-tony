Questions:

Contributors is probably aimed at the general public, porduct managers, or anyone who would like to see who is working on a project.
You can get to this data using the github api through https://github.com/mbostock/d3/graphs/contributors-data

Commits activity is probably mainly an internal tool used by product managers to see how productive the team is being.

Code frequency probably is useful to make sure that the codebase is being well maintained and is being trimmed as it grows.
It is likely useful for product managers.
You can acces the data using https://github.com/mbostock/d3/graphs/code-frequency-data.

Punch card is also likely used by product managers to help see what days the team was most productive.
You can access the data using https://github.com/mbostock/d3/graphs/punch-card-data.

Pulse is likely useful for product managers and the general public to understand who has
had the most commits which is perhaps correlated with bug fixes or productivity. This uses the data of commits per day. You
can use the api to get date of commit and then find the number of commits per each day.
You can access the data using https://github.com/mbostock/d3/commits/master.atom

If a contributor pushes many commits at once, this may change the look of the visualization. Thus, the data needs to be updated every
time the page loads. This is accomplished by the database likely being updated in real time and the api likely pulling from the
database.

Calydo network graph:
An interactive graph is much better than a static graph in this instance beceause it allows you to
scroll over the visualization to see how it changes over time.

If many develoerps join the graph may get very convoluted. You could solve this by changing the scale
so that only those branches with a large number of commits are prominently displayed.
