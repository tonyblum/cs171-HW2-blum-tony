Please find my code in problem4.html.

I chose to make my visualization of the commit frequency of the top 10 authors in the last 100 commits.
This is useful because it shows how much of the repository comes from one or just a few authors.
This gives people a better idea if the repository is coming from the community or if it is just coming from a few authors.

One new feature it would have been nice to add would have to been to show which authors had which frequency when I moused over
a certain bar on the chart.
