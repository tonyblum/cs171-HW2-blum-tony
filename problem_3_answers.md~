The github visaulizars are very good at displaying commit data. One new visualization which might be
nice would be a word cloud of authors names based on number of commits to visually see who was committing the most.
It would also be helpful to see a bar graph with the number of commits per date, to better understand which days were
most productive.

These 3 repositories are much bigger with many more commits and many more authors.

This would cause the graph to appear busier and more difficult to read.
