The github visaulizars are very good at displaying commit data. One new visualization which might be
nice would be a word cloud of authors names based on number of commits to visually see who was committing the most.
It would also be helpful to see a bar graph with the number of commits per date, to better understand which days were
most productive.

These 3 repositories are much bigger with many more commits and many more authors.

This would cause the graph to appear busier and more difficult to read.

One way to improve my visualization to address these issues would be to add some componenet of scale
so for instance if there are more than 10 commitors, only the 10 largest commitors are shown. Similarly,
only the 10 branches with the most accepted contributions might also be shown.
